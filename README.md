You need a TVDB API Key which you can easily require at [thetvdb.com](https://thetvdb.com/api-information). The access is free, as long as you're not selling the service.

## Setup
Requires python 3.11
### Virtualenv
Create a virtual environment with `virtualenv .venv`
Activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`
### Pipenv
Install dependencies with `pip install pipenv` followed by `pipenv install`

### .env Secrets
Copy the `.env.tmpl` file to `.env` and add all fields.

### Done

You can run it manually, which is not very useful, run it as a cron job or in some other form of automation.
